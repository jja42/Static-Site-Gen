    <article><div><h1>Radiant Elves</h1><p>The Radiant Elves hold the proud belief that they were crafted in the very image of the Celestial creators themselves. This divine heritage inspires many to live with grace and strive to positively shape the world around them.</p><p>Yet, this belief also breeds arrogance in some—especially among the noble houses—who see themselves as superior to all other races.
