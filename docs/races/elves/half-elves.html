    <article><div><h1>Half Elves</h1><p>Born from the union of various elven lineages—or between elves and humans—Half Elves often find themselves caught between worlds. Regarded as lesser by nearly all pure-blooded elves, they bear the weight of prejudice and exclusion.</p><p>In response, Half Elves have carved out their own enclave within the Elven realms—a sanctuary where they strive to overcome the long-standing condescension and segregation imposed by their ancestors. Here, diverse cultures blend, fostering resilience, unity, and hope for a future free from old divides.</p></div></article>
