    <article><div><h1>Vilund: The Land of Agriculture</h1><p>Vilund is the verdant heart of Elarion’s bounty — endless fields of grain, orchards heavy with fruit, and wild meadows that dance in the wind. Here, the land breathes life into all who dwell upon it, sustaining villages and cities alike with its generous harvests.</p><p>The Howlkin, a diverse race of humanoid mammalian folk, are the proud stewards of Vilund’s fertile soil. Born of earth and crop, their lives are deeply intertwined with the seasons and spirits that guard the land. Though many have sought to tame Vilund’s wild expanses through trade and regulation, the land’s ancient will remains untamed — fiercely protective of those who call it home.</p><p>Vilund is a place where nature’s gifts are both cherished and revered, a realm alive with the hum of growth and the promise of plenty.</p></div></article>
