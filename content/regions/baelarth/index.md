# Baelarth: The Land of Purity

Baelarth stands as the ancestral homeland of the Elves, a realm steeped in ancient magic and noble tradition. Its towering forests and crystal-clear lakes have witnessed the rise and fall of countless elven dynasties, each more proud and grand than the last.

The Imperial Elven families hold court here, their elegant cities shimmering with artistry and power. Though many Elves dwell within Baelarth’s borders, social divides run deep—segregation is the rule, save for the Half-Elf Enclave, a rare place where old prejudices momentarily fade.

Here, the air hums with the echoes of song and ceremony, where culture and history are treasured above all. Baelarth’s beauty is matched only by its complexity, a land where purity is both a blessing and a burden.
