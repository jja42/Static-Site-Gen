# Drekmore: The Land of Solitude

Drekmore is a realm shrouded in mist and mystery, where treacherous swamps and winding moats form natural barriers against the outside world. Isolation has shaped its people â€” wary, fierce, and bound by a history steeped in hardship and strife.

The Komonox, lizard-like warriors born of the marshes, and the Vorkul, towering orcish clans hardened by centuries of conflict, call Drekmore home. Though once peaceful, their past chains of cruel slavery and the scars of countless battles have forged a land rife with distrust.

Few outsiders dare to tread here, and fewer still return unchanged. Drekmore stands as a testament to survival, resilience, and the fierce independence of those who dwell within its shadowy borders.
