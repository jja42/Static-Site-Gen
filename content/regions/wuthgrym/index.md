# Wuthgrym: The Land of Promise

Wuthgrym rises from harsh landscapes—barren deserts, sheer cliffs, and lofty mountain peaks—that test the mettle of all who seek its embrace. Yet, amidst this rugged terrain, it harbors some of the most prosperous and peaceful cities in the world, thanks to its rich natural resources.

The swift Sand Runners roam the sun-drenched dunes, their vibrant garments a stark contrast to the golden sands. In the high cliffs, the Talonborn guard their ancient homes with fierce loyalty, their sharp talons and protowings glinting against the sky. At the highest reaches, the Mountain Scalers stand as stoic sentinels of their craggy domains—proud, unyielding, and resilient.

Traders and diplomats brave the difficult terrain to commune with the diverse peoples of Wuthgrym, forging alliances and trade routes that bind this land of extremes into a vibrant tapestry of culture and ambition.
