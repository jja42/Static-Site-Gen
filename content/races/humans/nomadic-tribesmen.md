# Nomadic Tribesmen

Unlike other races of Man who settled and adapted to specific homelands, the Nomadic Tribesmen embraced a life of constant movement and freedom. They make their homes wherever the winds take them, embracing both the liberation and the hardships that come with their wandering ways.

Renowned as excellent hunters and masters of survival, the Nomads are well organized into tight-knit groups, relying on cooperation and skill to thrive in diverse environments.

Though generally peaceful and valuing harmony, the Nomadic Tribesmen are not to be underestimated. They are known to bear long grudges and can wage fierce guerilla warfare when provoked, striking swiftly and vanishing into the wild.
