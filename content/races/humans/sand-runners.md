# Sand Runners

The Sand Runners are the spirited denizens of Wuthgrym’s vast and unforgiving deserts. Swift and graceful, they navigate the endless dunes with practiced ease, their movements a dance as fluid as the shifting sands.

Known for their love of vibrant, expensive garments and extravagant celebrations, Sand Runners revel in boasting and dance — their lively culture a stark contrast to the harshness of their environment. Yet beneath their indulgent exterior lies a people of remarkable resilience.

Hardworking and disciplined, Sand Runners are exceptional warriors, trained in refined combat techniques that have been passed down through generations. Their duality of flamboyance and fierce dedication makes them both captivating and formidable.
