# Mountain Scalers

The Mountain Scalers are the proud champions of Wuthgrym’s rugged and treacherous peaks. Stout of frame and hardy in build, their stature often earns them the nickname “dwarves,” though they wear the title with quiet dignity rather than offense.

Resilient and steadfast, the Mountain Scalers have honed their skills to thrive in harsh, unforgiving terrain where only the strongest endure. Their stern and stoic nature reflects generations of discipline and unyielding focus.

Known for their unwavering confidence and unwavering resolve, these mountain folk are as unmovable as the very cliffs they call home — guardians of their land and masters of their craft.
