# Plains Striders

The Plains Striders are the primary inhabitants of Primala, once celebrated for their wisdom, ambition, and pioneering spirit. Revered ancestors laid the foundations of a great civilization, and their legacy shaped the course of the land’s history.

However, in recent times, the name “Strider” has come to signify stagnation. Many see the current generation as complacent, too comfortable resting on the laurels of their forebears. Some believe this complacency has weakened Primala’s resolve, leaving it vulnerable to external threats and foreign influences.

Despite this reputation, the Plains Striders retain a deep connection to their heritage and the vast plains they call home—waiting for a spark to rekindle their former glory.
