# Estuar Elves

For generations, the Estuar Elves have been bound to the seas, their lives intertwined with the ebb and flow of tides and currents. Only in recent times—through arcane magic and subtle mutations—have they begun to venture upon the land.

Their time above water is limited, but their agility and grace make them masters of both realms. Settling near rivers, lakes, and marshes, Estuar Elves maintain fractured yet resilient communities across the mainland's watery borders.

Known for their formal manners and warm hospitality, they are a proud people who deeply revere the ‘natural order’—a sacred balance of life and environment. This respect extends to their discomfort with steel tools and weapons, favoring instead natural materials that honor their ancient traditions.
