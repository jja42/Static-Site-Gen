# Half Elves

Born from the union of various elven lineages—or between elves and humans—Half Elves often find themselves caught between worlds. Regarded as lesser by nearly all pure-blooded elves, they bear the weight of prejudice and exclusion.

In response, Half Elves have carved out their own enclave within the Elven realms—a sanctuary where they strive to overcome the long-standing condescension and segregation imposed by their ancestors. Here, diverse cultures blend, fostering resilience, unity, and hope for a future free from old divides.
