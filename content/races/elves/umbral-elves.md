# Umbral Elves

Long shadowed by the Radiant Elves' disdain, the Umbral Elves harbor deep resentment towards their luminous cousins. Centuries of condescension have sparked bitter wars and entrenched divisions between the two peoples, each conflict only hardening old wounds and prejudices.

In recent years, the focus of their scorn has shifted, with both Radiant and Umbral Elves casting judgment upon the Half Elvesâ€”those caught between worlds and often rejected by both.

Despite the fiery history with their Radiant kin, the Umbral Elves themselves are markedly more grounded and reserved. They prefer quiet contemplation and subtle strength over the boisterous displays of their neighbors, carrying a calm intensity beneath their shadowed veneer.
