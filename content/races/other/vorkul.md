# Vorkul

Much like the Komonox, the Vorkul were once enslaved by Man and Elf. This shared history has created a tenuous kinship between the two races, but deep mistrust still lingers, often erupting in deadly skirmishes.

The Vorkul are known for their imposing, burly warriors who march proudly into battle. Yet, beneath their fierce exterior, there exist smaller, craftier subsets that rely on cunning and stealth to survive and thrive.
