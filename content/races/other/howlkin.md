# Howlkin

Inhabitants of the fertile lands of Vilund, the Howlkin differ from other races more in culture than in form. Their deep connection to nature and the abundance surrounding them have left them unprepared for harsh, scarce lands beyond their home.

Known for their relaxed attitudes toward clothing and social intimacy, the Howlkin have often been misunderstood and labeled as degenerates by outsiders. Though many have evolved beyond these early traits, the wider world still views them as wild, untamed â€” closer to beasts than to civilized beings.
