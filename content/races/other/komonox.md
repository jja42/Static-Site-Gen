# Komonox

The Komonox are a fierce warrior race, ruled by instincts and a deep-seated paranoia. Long ago, they were enslaved by Elves and Man, their weaker and more thoughtful members ruthlessly eliminated for being perceived threats.

Despite their harsh past, the Komonox led a brutal uprising to overthrow their oppressors. Today, their society is more diverse â€” some have embraced the arts, while many still live by the blade, honing their combat skills and warrior traditions.
