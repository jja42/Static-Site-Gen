The Talonborn are enigmatic bird-like humanoids, rarely seen by other races. Their existence might have been dismissed as myth if not for the grandeur of their settlements and the breathtaking artistry they produce.

Though they remain scarce and secretive, recent times have seen the Talonborn quietly expand their numbers and claim new territories. Yet, only a few have ventured beyond their homeland, keeping their culture shrouded in mystery.
